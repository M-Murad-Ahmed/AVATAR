This project will investigate whether it is possible to obtain and process video game box art through scanning the cover, using a mobile device such as a tablet or smartphone. The end goal is to accurately identify and display information about the scanned image to the end user. By prototyping an application and replicating aspects of the real world we will be able to identify complications and find practical solutions. Upon success of creating such an application we will be able to provide further proof of real time image processing and demonstrate a practical use of augmented reality for everyday applications.
